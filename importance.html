    <h2>The Importance of Cinematic Music</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="explanation">Cinematic music, in my opinion, is highly important in various media. It can add more emotional impact to scenes in movies or video games, it can effect the viewer more than just visual queues. Not only can it bring out emotions such as sadness, it can also make the listener "feel" energetic, make them cheer during a battle, make them feel more immersed. These days, especially in video games, sound is much more crucial than video games. Not only music, but sound in general- dialogue, the story of said dialogue, sound design and music. Though, music itself can elevate all other sound or even mask it if it's bad. I love music, I love what it does for me, I love the emotional impact it has on me. I haven't talked to other people about it much, but I hope it works the same way for them too. <br> <br> I've included four videos that are absolutely elevated by their sound and music design. Give them a listen, imagine how much the effect of them would be different if the music was different.</div>
